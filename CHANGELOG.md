* Added `(Filterable f, Filterable g) => Filterable (Product f g)`
* Added `(Witherable f, Witherable g) => Witherable (Product f g)`
* Added `(Filterable f, Filterable g) => Filterable (Sum f g)`
* Added `(Witherable f, Witherable g) => Witherable (Sum f g)`
* Added `Filterable f => Filterable (IdentityT f)`
* Added `Witherable f => Witherable (IdentityT f)`
* Switched from strict `HashMap` operations to lazy ones. This
  matches the behavior of the rest of the instances.
